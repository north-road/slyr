# SLYR: the ESRI to QGIS Compatibility Suite

This is the documentation for North Road's **SLYR** tool.

**SLYR** offers the complete ArcMap/ArcGIS Pro to QGIS compatibility suite.
It allows you to seamless work with ESRI document formats from within QGIS, including
MXD, APRX, MAPX, LYR, LYRX, and many other ESRI formats.

SLYR offers the ability to directly import ESRI documents into QGIS, **without the
need for any ESRI software installation or licensing**. It also allows exporting QGIS
projects for use in ArcGIS Pro as APRX, MAPX or LYRX files.

SLYR is the **only** tool which provides [near perfect](user_guide/limitations) results,
with the converted projects almost always identically matching their original versions.

You can read more about SLYR at the [North Road](https://north-road.com/slyr) homepage,
including pricing information and purchasing instructions.

To get started with SLYR, read about [installing and updating](user_guide/installation)
the software. There's also a complete [reference](user_guide/tools) covering all the
tools and functionality offered by SLYR.
