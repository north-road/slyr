*The parties have agreed that North Road will license the Software to the Licensee and will provide upgrades and
updates (if any) to the Software in consideration for the License Fee. In consideration of the mutual covenants, terms,
and conditions set out in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:*

### 1. License

1.1. Subject to the Licensee’s continued compliance with all the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation,
payment of all fees payable under this Agreement), North Road grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable
license (and accordingly does not allow sublicensing of the Software to any other party) to:

a. use the Software within the scope of the License Type; and

b. install or imbed copies of the Software in accordance with the License Type.

1.2. North Road reserves the right to amend or vary the terms of this Agreement. If North Road varies or amends this
Agreement in accordance with this provision, North Road will provide the Licensee with a written copy of the variation
or amendment to this Agreement via the SLYR software. Any variation or amendment of this Agreement in accordance with
this provision will take immediate effect and where the Licensee continues to use the Software, it confirms its
agreement with the amended terms.

### 2. Restrictions

2.1. The Software is owned by North Road and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold. The Licensee receives no title to or
ownership of any copy of the Software itself and any Intellectual Property Rights contained in the Software continues to
be at all times owned by North Road. The Licensee receives no rights to the Software other than those specifically
granted in clause 1.

2.2. Unless it is in accordance with this Agreement, or North Road provides its written consent, the Licensee must not,
and must not permit any of its officers, employees, agents, contractors, or related companies to:

a. modify, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or sublicense the Software or
its associated content; or

b. use the Software or its content for the purpose of service bureau, time-sharing, web-hosting, software as a service,
cloud or other service or technology or in any way allow third parties to exploit the Software;

c. reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile or otherwise attempt to derive any of the Software’s source code; or

d. remove, alter or obscure any proprietary notices, labels or marks in the Software or North Road’s terms of use or
privacy policy contained in the Software.

2.3. The parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no license is
granted (whether expressly, by implication or otherwise) under this Agreement for use of the Software beyond the
applicable Term or outside the scope of the applicable License Type.

2.4. The Licensee warrants that it will reproduce all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or
partial copy, of the Software.

2.5. The Licensed Software is provided solely for the Licensee’s internal use. The Licensee may use the Software only
for projects and activities conducted directly by or on behalf of the Licensee. The Licensee must not use the Software
to provide services to third parties, including but not limited to consulting, analysis, development, or data processing
services. The Software may not be used as part of any commercial offering, hosted service, or deliverable provided to
clients or other external parties without the prior written consent of the Licensor.

2.6. If the Licensee intends to use the Software as part of a service offering to a third party or client, a separate
license must be purchased for each such client. This ensures that the client is appropriately licensed and that use of
the Software aligns with the Licensor’s terms of distribution and support.

Specifications, North Road may (if required) provide upgrades and updates to the Software to the Licensee.

North Road’s responsibility.

3.3. The Licensee agrees and acknowledges North Road is not liable for:

a. any damage caused to the Licensee’s equipment (inclusive of, without limitation, any hardware or software of the
Licensee); or
b. any costs, damage or delay arising from the upgrades and updates to the Software.

3.4. If, during the provision of upgrades and updates, North Road determines that additional services are required that
are:

a. not part of the upgrades and update;

b. services that arose out of the Licensee’s modifications to the Software; or

5.5. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if the *Competition and Consumer Act 2010* (Cth) provides that there is
a guarantee in relation to any good or service supplied by North Road in connection with this Agreement and North Road’s
liability for failing to comply with that guarantee cannot be excluded, but may be limited, then the limitation in
