## How much does SLYR cost?

See the [pricing](pricing) page for full details on purchasing the
full-featured
licensed version of SLYR.

## How many users will a license cover?

A single **SLYR** license agreement covers use by 20 users in the same physical
location i.e. an office address. It will also cover remote users that are
attached to the defined physical location. If you have multiple locations, or
over 20 users that require use of the license, please
let [us](mailto:info@north-road.com) know, and we will assess each case on an
individual basis.

## How can I purchase SLYR?

If you would like to purchase SLYR [email us](mailto:info@north-road.com). As
we often deal with
clients in Europe and America, there is often a lag due to the time differences
as we are located in Queensland, Australia (AEST, GMT+10).

To speed up the process, include the details below in your email so that we can
produce an invoice for you straight away. If you need a quote first, let us
know in the email and provide the same details listed below.

To create an invoice or quote, we require the following information:

> Organization name/Your name
>
> Office address
>
> VAT number (if in Europe)
>
> Purchase order number (if required)
>
> Expected number of users
>
> Type of users (in office/remote)

When we receive payment (via credit card or bank transfer), we will send
you the license and instructions for using **SLYR**.

## Can remote users use my SLYR license?

We work remotely too, so we know how you need to have access to all of your
tools! If you are attached to an office location, but work remotely, you are
covered under our license agreement.

## Are student versions available?

Unfortunately we do not offer a student version of **SLYR**. We recommend you
approach your institution to purchase **SLYR**.

## What support is available for SLYR?

North Road offers a high level of support to all **SLYR** purchases. You can
contact us at anytime via [email](mailto:info@north-road.com).

> - If there is a bug we will fix it to the best of our abilities and release
    it as soon as we can.
> - If you wish a tool to work in a certain way i.e. develop a new feature, and
    if there are no barriers to developing it (software constraints in
    QGIS/ESRI), we will attempt to do it.
> - If it is something that will require a high level of development, you can
    consider whether to join the current **Hall of Fame** and sponsor its
    development.

## Can I get a trial version of SLYR?

Evaluation versions of the tool are not available. If you require a sample to
evaluate prior to purchasing, email QGIS or ESRI files
to [North Road Support](mailto:info@north-road.com), and we will convert them
at
no cost for your evaluation.

## How do I get the latest version of SLYR?

SLYR is updated many times during the year, at least once per quarter. To find
out what has been updated in the latest version, check out the changelog in
the `QGIS Plugin Manager`.
Checkout [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting) on how to update your **SLYR**
version.

## What ESRI licenses do I need?

SLYR is designed so that you can push out ESRI products **without** the need of
an
ESRI license! You do **NOT** need to have any ESRI software installed in order
to
use SLYR. You only need to have [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
installed.

## What QGIS version do I need?

We always recommend running either the latest QGIS release or the current
QGIS "LTR" release. However, SLYR is compatible with older versions of QGIS,
anything from version 3.16 onwards can be used.

## What versions of ArcMap/ArcGIS are supported?

SLYR is compatible with files created using ArcMap 9.0 through to ArcMap 10.8.2,
and ArcGIS Pro versions 2 or 3. There is also support for converting AVL files
created using ArcView 3.x.

## How can I run SLYR tools outside QGIS?

While it's possible to call the **Python** modules directly from standalone
scripts, this is not recommend and is not officially supported by **North Road
**. However, the official endorsed way of running the tools outside **QGIS**
is to use the `qgis_process` CLI application which comes bundled with QGIS.

## File Formats

SLYR uses many file formats. If you're unfamiliar with these formats, check
