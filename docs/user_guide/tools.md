# SLYR Tools #

## Before you start ##
Here is a checklist to help your conversions and workings with **SLYR** run a little bit smoother.

> ✔️ **Populate settings requirements:**  set-up the **SLYR Options** following these [guidelines](https://slyr.north-road.com/user_guide/setup_slyr).
>
> ✔️ **Set up your folders:**  **SLYR** will record the pathways from the original data locations, so there is no need to have a special set-up. However, you may want to set-up a structure so you can keep outputs tidy. 
>
> ✔️ **Access to files:**  ensure you have access to bespoke files such .svg, fonts, and images. Note that there is some [limitations](https://slyr.north-road.com/user_guide/limitations) with QGIS Svg files.
> 
> ✔️ **Geopackages:** ArcGIS Pro and Geopackages has not yet reached full support. Therefore an error will be produced if you are exporting from a geopackage.   
>   
>      Warning: Railway: Converting .gpkg layers is not yet fully supported, layer path has been replaced with a dummy shapefile path.
>   - See [Troubleshooting](https://slyr.north-road.com/user_guide/troubleshooting) for the workaround.
> 
> ✔️ **Symbology:**  If you are using rule-based renderers, these are not yet available in ArcGIS Pro. See the [Limitations](https://slyr.north-road.com/user_guide/limitations). 
> 
> ✔️ **Error Messages:**   If a tool returns an error:
  > - Saying it is not available, if you are using the Community Edition, it may not yet be available. 
  > - All other errors, read through the `Log`, check the [Troubleshooting](https://slyr.north-road.com/user_guide/troubleshooting) page on how to recitfy the issue and rerun the tool. If there is no recitifcation, please [email us](mailto:info@north-road.com).

5. Under the `Advanced` group you can find options for filtering the symbols from the Stylx database to convert. You can filter by object type or by entering a wildcard text string to match against the symbol names. The wildcard filter can include the `*` character or `?` character to match against multiple characters or a single character, eg `*wall*` will match any symbol with wall in the symbol name.  
6. Click on `Run`.
7. Once it has converted, you can import the *XML* file via the `Style Manager` ▶️ `Import/Export`.
