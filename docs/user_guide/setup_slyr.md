# Set-up SLYR #
<!-- it would be nice to only give access to this page to purchasers -->

## Install the plugin (community version) ##

The community version of SLYR can be installed through the QGIS Plugin Manager. Just search for "SLYR" and click "Install Plugin".

## Install the plugin (licensed version) ##

Once purchased, licensed users will receive an email from **North Road** with a link for the installer and their licence key. 

**Before installing the licensed version of SLYR, you must first uninstall the community version (if installed) and restart QGIS.**

1. Save the information in this email, along with your invoice and receipt in a safe place for future reference.

2. Download the installer from the link. 
      * Place the zip file in a safe location for future reference - just in case you need to update your machine so you can reload it.

3. Unzip the downloaded file, and then drag the extracted `install_slyr_qgis.py` over an open **QGIS** window. (If prompted, accept the warning regarding trusted scripts). The script will add a connection to the private plugins repository, and install the **SLYR** plugin for you.

4. After the plugin is installed, the **SLYR** `Options` dialog will open (If it doesn't, click on the top menu `Settings` ▶️ `Options` and click on **SLYR** in the left panel). Enter your unique license key at this screen, exactly as it appears at the end of this email. Enter the optional requirements outlined in the *SLYR Options* section below.

## SLYR Options ##
The **SLYR** `Options` dialog provides users the ability to set-up the **SLYR** Plugin to meet their requirements. 

To access the **SLYR** `Options`, in **QGIS** click on the top menu `Settings` ▶️ `Options`.

The `Options` dialog opens, scroll down on the left and click on **SLYR** to access the **SLYR** options.

### Conversion Settings ###
| Setting | Description | Directions |
| ---| --- | --- |

Convert font markers to simple marker symbols where possible | When activated, SLYR will automatically detect any font markers using standard ESRI fonts which can be converted to an equivalent simple marker symbol in QGIS. In most cases this option is desirable, as it results in QGIS styles which do not require ESRI fonts to work as originally designed. Additionally, the simple marker versions generally result in more exact matches for the original marker sizes and offsets. Deactivate this option only if you have a particular requirement to retain all font markers as QGIS font marker symbols. |  Tick to activate. 
Convert font markers to SVG files | This option will perform a conversion of any font markers to QGIS SVG marker symbol. The original fonts referenced in the ArcMap documents must be available at the time of conversion in order to do this, but the resultant files will be self-contained and no longer require access to the fonts. Activating this option can result in larger converted file sizes. |  Tick to activate.
Embed pictures inside symbols when possible | When checked, any pictures or SVG files referenced in the ArcMap documents will be embedded inside the resultant QGIS files. This results in a self-contained file which can easily be distributed to others. If unchecked, then pictures or SVG files will be placed in the "Store extracted pictures in" folder. These must then be supplied alongside the converted QGIS file to other users. |  Tick to activate. 
Tweak symbol conversion for better visual match | Activating this option enables SLYR to alter the original sizes and line thickness of symbols from ArcMap in order to result in a better visual match for how these symbols are shown in ESRI software. If deactivated, then all sizes will remain exactly as they were in the original documents. |  Tick to activate. 
Units for symbols: points, millimeters | Controls whether the converted QGIS symbols should use points or millimeters for sizes, widths and offsets. **SLYR** uses points as a default in order to match the units used by ESRI software, but users may wish to change this to millimeters if they are more comfortable working in these units. |  Choose either `Points` or `Millimeters`.
Store extracted pictures in | Sets a path to store any extracted pictures from ESRI documents. This setting is only used when the "Embed pictures inside symbols when possible" option is disabled. |  Enter in the folder's path
Store relative paths for files instead of absolute paths | Using relative paths will assist with portability of the project. |  Tick to activate. 
Convert font markers to simple marker symbols where possible | All Symbol marker symbols will loose any complexity. WILL THIS MIRROR THE CHOSEN SYMBOLS CLOSELY? WILL IT LOSE ALL COLOUR AS WELL? |  Tick to activate. 
Convert font markerts to SVG files | Use this option if you have access to the original SVG files and they are saved in.  |  Tick to activate. Ensure the location is addded into the **QGIS** `Options` dialog (check [Troubleshooting](/user_guide/troubleshooting) for more information).
*delete*Embed pictures inside symbols when possible | Symbols containing pictures are assumed to have placement inside symbols. If your pictures occur outside of symbols, don't activate this option. IS THIS CORRECT???? |  Tick to activate. 
Tweak symbol conversion for better visual match | A variety of scripts can be employed to get a better match, such as PROVIDE EXAMPLES OR FURTHER CLARIFICATION> |  Tick to activate. 
Units for symbols: points, millimeters | Symbols use points or millimeters to measure them. **SLYR** uses points as a default. |  Choose either `Points` or `Millimeters`.
*delete* Store extracted pictures in | Pictures are extracted and processed using Inkscape. The files will then need a storage location. WHAT PICTURES ARE TALKING ABOUT - FROM SYMBOLS OR PHOTOS LINKED IN THE PROJECT |  Enter in the folder's path
*delete*Store relative paths for files instead of absolute paths | Using relative paths will assist with portability of the project. |  Tick to activate. 


### SDE Database Conversion ###

These settings control how SLYR converts SDE connections to QGIS database connections. 

| Setting | Description | Directions |
| ---| --- | --- |
Default primary key | QGIS requires that the primary key for a database table is specified in advance. Since ArcMap documents do **not** include this information, SLYR defaults to using "objectid" as the primary key name. If your database setup uses a different primary key you can change this setting to ensure that SDE connections are correctly converted to QGIS database connections. | Leave as OBJECTID or amend as required. 
Table name conversion | While ArcMap is tolerant to case differences in the name of SDE tables and schemas, QGIS is instead case sensitive. If the case stored in an ArcMap document differs from the actual database table name case then QGIS will not be able to read the resultant layer. This setting permits users to specify a case conversion in order to automatically adjust the stored ArcMap table and schema name case to match the actual casing used on a database. If you are having issues with QGIS being unable to read converted SDE connections then correcting the case conversion using this setting may help. | Choose from the options: Leave unchanged, Convert to Uppercase, OR Convert to Lowercase

### MDB Tools ###

SLYR requires use of "MDB Tools" in order to read ArcMap .style files. While the licensed version of SLYR is packaged with an inbuilt version of MDB Tools, users of the community version will need to manually download and install MDB Tools and then setup the MDB tools path in this section.

| Setting | Description | Directions |
| ---| --- | --- |
Path to MDB Tools | This is automatically set for the full license, *only the Community License needs to download this tool*. | Click the link in the SLYR Options dialog and once installed, enter in the installed MDB Tools path

### Inkscape ###

SLYR requires the free, open-source Inkscape illustration application in order to convert any EMF graphics found in ArcMap documents. Inkscape must be manually installed from [here](https://inkscape.org) or EMF graphics will not be converted and will be unusable in QGIS.

| Setting | Description | Directions |
| ---| --- | --- |
Path to Inkscape | Path to the Inkscape binary (.exe) file.  |  Install Inkscape from [here.](https://inkscape.org) and enter the pathway to Inkscape .exe file.
